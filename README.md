machine learning for petroleum engineering
learning from past experience E with respect to task T, and get the performance P.
According to machine learning from drilling data such as surface data, wellbore geometry data, lithology(formation characteristics), and downhole measurements from various downhole tools, we can predict drilling events such as severe vibration, stuck pipe, fluid loss, sudden equivalent criculation density changes.
